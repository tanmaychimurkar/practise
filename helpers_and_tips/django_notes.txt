Django follows the common MVC flow, where the model is the database ORMs, the views are the html files that we want the
user to see on the webpage, and the controller are the files that route the user from one place to another.

In Django, we can always create ORMs that are agnostic to the type of database that they connect to, and this is
handeled internally by django.
