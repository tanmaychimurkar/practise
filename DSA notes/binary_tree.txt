In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children.

There are different traversal methods for traversing a binary tree. They are:

1) Pre-order traversal: We start from the root, and travel the left subtree first, then the right subtree. Can be
solved either recursively or using stack for iterative solution. Recursive solution is DFS, as we traverse the tree
by the depth first to left and then by depth to the right.

2) In-order traversal: Travel the left subtree first, then root, then right subtree

3) Post order traversal: We travel the left subtree first, then the right subtree, then the root node at the end

4) level order traversal: This is the implementation of BFS for getting the node output by each level of the tree
