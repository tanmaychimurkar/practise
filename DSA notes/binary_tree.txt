In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children.

There are different traversal methods for traversing a binary tree. They are:

1) Pre-order traversal: We start from the root, and travel the left subtree first, then the right subtree.

2) In-order traversal: Travel the left subtree first, then root, then right subtree

3) Post order traversal: We travel the left subtree first, then the right subtree, then the root node at the end

4)
