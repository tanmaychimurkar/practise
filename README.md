# Things to Remember

### This repository includes the following list of things I want to remember about some of the stuff that I use in my everyday life, and some general concepts:

##### - Python OOP notes as an extension of Bernd Klein's coursework and some from the Python Documentation
##### - Reinforcement Learning structure and architecure in general
##### - `Ray Tune` and `Ray RLlib` for distributed reinforcement learning (and deep learning)
##### - Docker and compose to `dockerize` projects
##### - Leetcode solutions
##### - Git stuff that I use freuently

More things will be added as I go along!
